	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

		1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

		(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

 	Basic strategy here is simple: loop from 1 to n, summing squares and the running sum. Then square the sum
 	and take the difference of the squared sum and summed squares.

 	Nothing too fancy, except a consideration for overflow, which is fairly tolerable if we use longs vs ints.
