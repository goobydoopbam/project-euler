	A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

	Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

 	Brute force could work; simply test every pair of numbers between 100 and 999 and check if the number is a palindrome (comparing / and % 10s or string manipulation)

 	Better would be to do a bit of mathematical reasoning to eliminate some of the numbers.

	In the simplest case for a palindromic number where n = 1, we'd be looking for something of the form aa, where a is a specific digit.
	It is easy to see that this is not possible; no two single digit numbers can be multiplied to produce a result of the form 11 * a.

	For n = 2, like in the given example, we are considering numbers between 10^2 and 99^2, so they must be of the form abba, where a,b are digits.
	In another form, 1001 * a + 110 * b = 11 (91a + 10b).

 	If we think about the n = 3 case, they are of the form abccba, where a,b,c are all single digits. In other terms,
 	for n = 3 we could write this as 100000 * a + 10000 * b + 1000 * c + 100 * c + 10 * b + a = 100001a + 10010b + 1100c = 11 * (9091a + 910b + 100c)

 	Similarly, for n = 4 this would amount to 11 * (909091a + 90910b + 9100c + 1000d).

 	So we are looking for numbers between 100^2 and 999^2 that are the product of two numbers (x * y) that satisfy this formula.
 	Solving the formula for every combination of numbers is a tough sell performance-wise, but we can take a hint from it to 
 	reduce our search space: we only need to consider a pair if one (and only one) of the two numbers is a multiple of 11.

 	Now our nested for loop can decrement one of the counters by 11 instead of 1, and we can further improve things by only checking numbers
